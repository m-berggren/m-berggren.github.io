Hello there, my name is **Marcus Berggren**! &#128075;

I'm a Software Engineering student at the joint department of Computer Science and Engineering at **Chalmers and Gothenburg University**, working on turning interesting ideas into code.

Beyond coding, I love spending time outdoors. You'll find me climbing rocks, paddling kayaks, setting up camp in the wilderness, or skiing down slopes when winter comes around.

Check out what I've been working on at [GitHub](https://github.com/m-berggren){:target="_blank"}
